## Fish Market 

The goal of this homework is to training a regression model to predict the weight of a fish using some of the features.
First, I analyzed how the fish measurements were made and then I researched how is the best way to predict the weight of a fish based on its measurements. 
The research showed that I can use this formula to predict the weight (length x girth x girth)/800.
Since I don't have the girth measurement in the dataset, I decided to do the reverse formula to find the girth (Square root of (weight*800)/2. Then I tryed
